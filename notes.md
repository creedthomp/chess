    go to chess piece tests
    recommended process:
        Start by executing the BishopMoveTests.bishopMoveUntilEdge test.
        Observe what code is throwing a Not implemented exception.
        Replace the code that is throwing the exception with something reasonable.
        Rerun the test, debug, and continue implementing until the test passes.
        Commit your changes to GitHub.
        Repeat the above process for each of the tests until they all pass.
